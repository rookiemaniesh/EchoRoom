## Lessons Learned

Gained hands-on experience with WebSocket by implementing a custom real-time server without using Express or HTTP routing.

Learned how to manage room-based communication logic, including identifying connected users, grouping them by room, and broadcasting messages accordingly.

Understood how to persist socket connections, handle message types, and manage basic socket events like connection and message.

Improved skills in structuring a full-stack app, connecting a WebSocket backend with a modern React frontend.

Became more comfortable with frontend-backend integration for real-time apps and how to deploy them to WebSocket-compatible platforms.
